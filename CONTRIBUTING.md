## Contributing Process

### 1. Create an Issue

Before starting work on a feature or bug fix, please create an issue to discuss:

- **Bug reports**: Include reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior
- **Feature requests**: Describe the feature, its use case, and potential implementation
- **Documentation**: Describe what documentation needs to be improved or added

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions or improvements

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new state management feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in component cleanup"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
```

#### Commit Types

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions or modifications
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
2. Ensure code follows style guidelines: `npm run lint`
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Add or update tests for new features
5. Rebase your branch on the latest upstream main:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

### Pull Request Template

When creating a pull request, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of what changes were made
- **Motivation**: Why this change is needed
- **Testing**: How the changes were tested
- **Breaking Changes**: Any breaking changes (with migration guide)
- **Checklist**: Complete the provided checklist

### Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one review from a maintainer
2. All checks must pass (tests, linting, etc.)
3. PRs should be up to date with the main branch
4. Address all review comments before merging

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Export types and interfaces that might be useful to consumers

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing project structure

### Performance Considerations

- Consider the impact on bundle size
- Optimize for common use cases
- Profile performance-critical code
- Document any performance trade-offs

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Test Organization

- Unit tests: `src/__tests__/`
- Integration tests: Include in relevant test files
- Test utilities: `src/__tests__/utils.ts`

### Testing Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Use meaningful assertions

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**: JSDoc comments for public APIs
2. **README**: Keep the main README up to date
3. **Examples**: Add examples for new features
4. **Storybook**: Create stories for new components

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Keep examples up to date

### Updating Documentation

When adding features:

1. Update the main README if needed
2. Add JSDoc comments to public APIs
3. Create or update Storybook stories
4. Add examples to demonstrate usage

## Issue Guidelines

### Before Creating an Issue

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Check the documentation and examples
3. Try to reproduce the issue with a minimal example

### Bug Reports

Include:

- **Environment**: Node.js version, OS, browser (if applicable)
- **Steps to reproduce**: Minimal reproduction steps
- **Expected behavior**: What you expected to happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happened
- **Code sample**: Minimal code that reproduces the issue

### Feature Requests

Include:

- **Problem**: What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives**: What alternatives have you considered?
- **Use case**: Describe your specific use case

### Questions

For questions about usage:

1. Check the documentation first
2. Look at existing examples
3. Search existing issues and discussions
4. Create a discussion rather than an issue

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Version bumping follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
2. Changelog is automatically generated from commit messages
3. npm packages are published automatically via CI/CD

### Semantic Versioning

- **MAJOR** version: Breaking changes
- **MINOR** version: New features (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH** version: Bug fixes (backwards compatible)

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:

- The project's README
- Release notes for significant contributions
- The contributors page (when available)

## Getting Help

If you need help:

1. Check the documentation
2. Look at existing examples
3. Search existing issues
4. Create a discussion for questions
5. Join our community (links in README)
